This branch is based on revision 570 from the original mercurial repo. Revision 570 is the only 'stable' state of the original source.

The sole purpose of this git repo is to make FFDECSA (via sasc's loopback interface) available for use with MythTV and such.

You can use it with kernel version 3.x and up, including more recent kernels (3.7.x and up)

dvbdev.h is included for all cases, so you must not set --dvb_dir=/path/to/your/kernel/sources anymore. This setting is now reserved for use in case that you have to compile and install newest dvb drivers from v4l. Mind you, if you do, you should apply proper dvb-mutex patch to your v4l sources prior to compiling.

If you are running Debian, you don't need to recompile your kernel anymore, the running kernel will be properly patched. Just checkout the debian branch.

USAGE:
git clone https://github.com/bas-t/sasc.git
cd sasc/contrib/sasc-ng
git checkout stable (or debian)
./configure <opts>
make && make module

If you know what FFDECSA optimisation is best for you, you can set it like:

./configure --compiletype=release --ffdecsa_mode=PARALLEL_128_SSE
