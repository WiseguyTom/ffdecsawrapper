Due to 'Hollywood' legislation, the use of this software is illegal in most countrys! (but not in my country, hehe)

The purpose of this git repo is to make FFDECSA (via ffdecsawrapper's loopback interface) available for use with MythTV and such.

You can use it with kernel version 3.x and up, including more recent kernels (latest ok test: 3.11-rc7)

dvbdev.h is included for all cases, so you must not set --dvb_dir=/path/to/your/kernel/sources anymore. This setting is now reserved for use in case that you have to compile and install newest dvb drivers from v4l (or TBS and other out of kernel drivers). Mind you, if you do, you should apply proper dvb-mutex patch to your sources prior to compiling. If you are not sure on how to do this, you can find basic instructions here:

http://www.lursen.org/wiki/V4l_and_ffdecsawrapper

If you are running Debian with a Debian kernel, you don't need to recompile your kernel anymore, the running kernel will be properly patched. That is, if your sources.list is ok and the source for your Debian kernel is available from the repo's.

USAGE:
git clone https://github.com/bas-t/ffdecsawrapper.git
cd ffdecsawrapper
./configure <opts>
make && make module

If you know what FFDECSA optimisation is best for you, you can set it like:

./configure --compiletype=release --ffdecsa_mode=PARALLEL_128_SSE

CLEAN AND UPDATE SOURCES:
make update
(as of sep 7 2013)
