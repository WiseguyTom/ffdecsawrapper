This branch is based on revision 570. The stable one. Hence this branches name.

It's sole purpose is to make FFDECSA (via sasc's loopback interface) available for use with MythTV and such.

VDR uses other plugins now.

You can use it with kernel version 2.6.38 and up, including more recent kernels (3.7.x and up)

dvbdev.h is included for all cases, so you don't have to set --dvb-dir=/path/to/your/kernel/sources anymore. It is still possible though.

If you know what FFDECSA optimisation is best for you, you can set it like:

./configure --ffdecsa_mode=PARALLEL_128_SSE
